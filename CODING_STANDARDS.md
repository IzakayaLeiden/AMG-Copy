Coding standards JavaScript & Python

1. Variable naming: use _ within words and no capital letters, e.g., my_variable, how_many_apples.

2. Place first brace on the same line as the function, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:_Stroustrup for more details.

3. Avoid global variables, use only if needed.

4. For function names, same as variable names. Do not make functions too long, if too long split the function in several parts.

5. At the beginning of a file, place as commment these information: name of the file in capitals, contributers, compiler, python/javascript version and description. Also document above the lines where you think people might need explanation to understand.

6. In the commit messages explain what the commit include in one line, do not make a commit too big.
